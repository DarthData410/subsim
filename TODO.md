  what():  Trying to save an unregistered polymorphic type (Sub_AI).
  Make sure your type is registered with CEREAL_REGISTER_TYPE and that the archive you are using was included (and registered with CEREAL_REGISTER_ARCHIVE) prior to calling CEREAL_REGISTER_TYPE.
  If your type is already registered and you still see this error, you may need to use CEREAL_REGISTER_DYNAMIC_INIT.
